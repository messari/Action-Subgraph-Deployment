# Messari Subgraph Deployment Action
- The purpose of this action is to be used by the Messari subgraph development team for deploying subgraphs upon merging with the main repository. 
- This action works by collecting a list of all changed files, and determining the proper commands to run to deploy the subgraphs that have had files changed that indicate the need for deployment.
